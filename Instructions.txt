## Start the script.
# Start the python server (assuming you have python installed).
python -m http.server
# If python doesn't work try python3.
# Type in the browser URL bar localhost:xxxx, where xxxx is the port given by python, normally it is 8000

## Interface:

# The interface consists of two sections: the cards container and the control panel.
# The cards container displays the phrase/acronym to be guessed, along with input fields and buttons for interaction.
# The control panel includes options to turn on dark mode, adjust #timer settings, and view game statistics.

## Using the software - general:

# The goal is to guess the correct acronym or phrase displayed on the card.
# If the timer is on, you have a limited time to make a guess. Otherwise, you can take your time.
# Enter your guess in the input field provided and click "Submit Guess" to see if it is correct.
# If your guess is correct, the card will flash green briefly and the next card will be displayed.
# If you guessed at least one letter the card will briefly flash yellow and the next card will be displayed.
# If your guess is wrong, the card will briefly flash red and the next card will be displayed.

# You can also click on the "Hint" button to reveal a random letter in the sentence, but this option is only available if there are still hidden letters.
# If the csv column is corroborated, it is displayed on the bottom edge of the card, from which pdf/source the acronym was extracted.

## Using the software - timer:

# You can turn the timer on or off using the checkbox named "Timer duration."
# Adjust the timer duration by selecting the desired time (5, 10 or 15 seconds) from the drop-down menu.

## Dark mode:

# Switch between light and dark mode using the checkbox labeled "Dark mode."
# Dark mode provides a different visual theme for the interface.

## Score:

# The software keeps track of total correct answers and total questions answered.
# This data is displayed in the counter section of the control panel.

## End of Game:

# The game ends when all acronyms have been guessed correctly or when there are no more unanswered questions.
# Once the game ends, a "Game over" message will be displayed on the card.

## Additional Notes:

# Phrases are loaded from an external data source (data.csv) and mixed.
# If you need to add or change acronym, you can do so in the CSV file following the format: Acronym, Name, File Name, Include.
# The words in the Name section starting with a lower case letter will not be hidden
# By setting Include to 0 (instead of 1) that line will not be loaded.
# Make sure the CSV file is properly formatted and accessible to the software.
